# Environment Configuration

Environment configuration refers to the setup and adjustment of computer systems or software to make them work correctly. In software development, it means preparing the right conditions for coding and testing. In a broader sense, it also includes efforts to make our surroundings more eco-friendly, like saving energy and reducing waste to protect the environment.
