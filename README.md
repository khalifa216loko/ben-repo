# Environment configuration
     Environment configuration refers to the setup 
     and adjustment of computer systems or software 
     to make them work correctly. In software 
     development, it means preparing the right 
     conditions for coding and testing. In a broader 
     sense, it also includes efforts to make our 
     surroundings more eco-friendly, like saving 
     energy and reducing waste to protect the 
     environment.
